# SteamMirrorShader
My Steam Mirror shader generates a randomised steam effect using perlin noise. This can be drawn on with either the mouse or a touch screen.
This can be used for gameplay by comparing it another image and scoring based on similarity.

The size of the smudge can be customised.

By providing an image with just black and red values to compare how similar they are.

You can then get a score based on similarity.

The steam is generated using perlin noise to be diffrent every playthrough but can easily be replaced by a set texture.
